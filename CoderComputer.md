- Text Editors

There isn't one text editor to rule them all. It is all about preference and what features you like and dislike. As long as it can get the job done you have to pick which one to use. A text editor and an IDE are very different though. A text editor only edits text while and IDE is a suite of a ton of software. It is a text editor, compiler, file manager, and debugger.
