# Wireframe

A wireframe is a low fidelity sketch of a digital interface. Outline/barebones.
There are 2 types of wireframes. Digital and hand drawn. basic shapes. Keep it simple. Do more than one sketch then go to a digital wireframe. 
Think through the process and feel free to change the sketch at any time. Try making a login screen?
