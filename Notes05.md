Css is a very useful language when coding websites. It allows you to get a little more detail than HTML would. HTML can be used as a good structure point then CSS is used to get the details in. 

CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets

There is an order if you create more than one style sheet that CSS takes.

CSS can use multiple different ways to pick the color so you can get it down to the nearest 1 value.
CSS Supports most if not all browsers as well so it is a good all around language to use.
